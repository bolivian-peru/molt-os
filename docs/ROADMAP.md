### osmoda-mesh — what it does

Any two osModa instances can form a direct encrypted connection. Invite code → peer accepts → Noise_XX handshake + ML-KEM-768 hybrid post-quantum key exchange → encrypted TCP channel. No central server. No global registry. Post-quantum by default.

```
osModa server A                    osModa server B
  osmoda-mesh                        osmoda-mesh
       │                                  │
       │  1. A creates invite code        │
       │  2. B accepts invite             │
       │  3. Noise_XX handshake ──────────│
       │  4. ML-KEM-768 PQ exchange ──────│
       │  5. Hybrid re-key ───────────────│
       │  6. Encrypted messages ──────────│
```

**Mesh bridge tools** (11): `mesh_identity`, `mesh_invite_create`, `mesh_invite_accept`, `mesh_peers`, `mesh_peer_send`, `mesh_peer_disconnect`, `mesh_health`, `mesh_room_create`, `mesh_room_join`, `mesh_room_send`, `mesh_room_history`

**Cipher suite**: Noise_XX (X25519/ChaChaPoly/BLAKE2s) + ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203) + HKDF-SHA256 hybrid. If classical crypto breaks, PQ protects. If PQ breaks, classical protects.

**Port**: 18800 TCP. **Socket**: `/run/osmoda/mesh.sock`.

## Sprint 1 — Remote Access + Safety (SHIPPED)

Remote access and safety slash commands.

### 1. Cloudflare Tunnel Integration

**What it does:** Gives your osModa server a persistent public URL with zero port forwarding, zero firewall config. Works from any device, any network.

**How:** cloudflared daemon opens an outbound connection to Cloudflare's edge. They route traffic back to localhost. Free tier is unlimited for personal use.

**NixOS config:**
```nix
services.osmoda.remoteAccess.cloudflare = {
  enable = true;
  credentialFile = "/var/lib/osmoda/secrets/cloudflare-tunnel";
  hostname = "osmoda.yourdomain.com";  # optional — leave blank for free trycloudflare.com URL
};
```

**Setup flow:**
1. Enable in NixOS config
2. Run `cloudflared tunnel login` once — saves credentials
3. `nixos-rebuild switch`
4. Access osModa from anywhere via the assigned URL

**Files:** `nix/modules/osmoda.nix` (~25 LOC), `docs/REMOTE-ACCESS.md`

**Latency:** 50-100ms added (Cloudflare edge routing). Fine for chat.

---

### 2. Tailscale Integration

**What it does:** Creates a WireGuard mesh VPN between your devices. Install Tailscale on your phone → access osModa directly via Tailscale IP. Zero config, end-to-end encrypted, no third party in the data path.

**NixOS config:**
```nix
services.osmoda.remoteAccess.tailscale = {
  enable = true;
  # Run once: sudo tailscale up --auth-key=tskey-...
};
```

**Best for:** Personal use, team access, situations where you don't want Cloudflare handling your traffic.

**Free tier:** 100 devices, unlimited bandwidth.

**Files:** `nix/modules/osmoda.nix` (~15 LOC)

**Latency:** 5-20ms (direct WireGuard, hole-punched). Faster than Cloudflare Tunnel.

---

### 3. Safety Slash Commands

**What it does:** Commands that bypass the AI entirely. When the AI is broken, stuck, or you need instant action — these work.

**Commands:**
```
/rollback       — immediately nixos-rebuild --rollback, no AI involved
/status         — raw health dump direct from agentd, bypasses conversation
/panic          — stop all services, rollback NixOS, log to ledger
/restart        — restart osmoda-gateway (use when AI is unresponsive)
```

**Why this matters:** RosClaw ships `/estop` that kills the robot regardless of what the AI is doing. osModa needs the equivalent for servers. If OpenClaw gets into a loop or the AI does something wrong, you need an escape hatch that doesn't go through the AI.

**Implementation:** OpenClaw slash commands registered at plugin level, execute shell commands directly, skip the AI pipeline entirely.

**Files:** `packages/osmoda-bridge/index.ts` (~80 LOC)

---

### 4. Discord Channel Config

**What it does:** Adds Discord as a messaging channel alongside Telegram + WhatsApp.

Discord is the natural habitat for developers — larger audience than either other channel for a dev tool.

**NixOS config:**
```nix
services.osmoda.channels.discord = {
  enable = true;
  botTokenFile = "/var/lib/osmoda/secrets/discord-bot-token";
  allowedGuildIds = [ "123456789" ];  # restrict to your server
};
```

**Setup via chat (same as Telegram):**
> "Connect Discord"
> AI guides through: create bot at discord.com/developers → copy token → paste it

**Files:** `nix/modules/osmoda.nix` (~20 LOC), `templates/AGENTS.md` (+Discord setup instructions)

---

## Sprint 2 — Ecosystem + Payments (SHIPPED: mcpd)

### 5. osmoda-mcpd — MCP Server Manager (SHIPPED)

**What it does:** Makes any MCP server a first-class osModa capability. The AI gets web scraping, database access, GitHub tools, and any other MCP server without writing a single line of bridge code.

**Design:** see `docs/MCP-ECOSYSTEM.md`

Small Rust daemon that manages MCP server processes (starts, restarts, health monitors), generates OpenClaw config entries for each, and routes outbound traffic through the egress proxy.

**NixOS config:**
```nix
services.osmoda.mcp.servers = {
  scrapling.enable = true;
  scrapling.allowedDomains = [ "*.github.com" ];
  postgres.enable = true;
  github.enable = true;
  github.secretFile = "/var/lib/osmoda/secrets/github-token";
};
```

**Files:** `crates/osmoda-mcpd/` (~400 LOC), `nix/modules/osmoda.nix` (~60 LOC)

---

### 6. x402 OS-Native Micropayments

**What it does:** When any daemon or MCP server makes an HTTP request and gets a `402 Payment Required`, osmoda-egress intercepts it, osmoda-keyd signs a USDC payment (ERC-3009) within policy, retries the request, logs to ledger. Fully transparent — callers see a normal 200 response.

**Design:** see `docs/X402.md`

osModa already has ETH wallets (osmoda-keyd), a policy engine (daily limits, per-domain), and an HTTP proxy (osmoda-egress). x402 wires them together.

**NixOS config:**
```nix
services.osmoda.keyd.x402 = {
  enable = true;
  dailyBudgetUsd = "1.00";
  allowedDomains = [ "api.quicknode.com" "api.anthropic.com" ];
};
```

**Files:** `crates/osmoda-keyd/src/api.rs` (~100 LOC), `crates/osmoda-egress/src/main.rs` (~80 LOC), bridge tools (~40 LOC)

---

### 7. Semantic Memory (usearch + fastembed)

**What it does:** Upgrades `memory_recall` from keyword-only (FTS5, already live) to hybrid keyword + semantic search. Catches queries like "times the server struggled" even when logs say "high load" or "cpu spike".

**Why not ZVEC, why not PageIndex:**
- ZVEC: 500MB+ model, Python sidecar, significant complexity
- PageIndex: cloud API, data leaves the machine (violates principle #3)

**The right stack:** `fastembed-rs` (pure Rust, ~22MB all-MiniLM model, ONNX runtime) + `usearch` (in-process C++ vector search, Rust bindings). Zero new daemons. Zero Python. Runs fully inside agentd.

**What changes:**
- agentd gains two new Cargo deps: `fastembed` + `usearch`
- Model downloads to `/var/lib/osmoda/memory/model/` on first boot (22MB)
- `memory/ingest` embeds events in background (non-blocking, FTS5 is immediate)
- `memory/recall` runs FTS5 first, then usearch, RRF-merges ranked results
- FTS5 remains live fallback while model loads

**Files:** `crates/agentd/Cargo.toml` (+2 deps), `crates/agentd/src/api/memory.rs` (~100 LOC)

---

### 9. Zod Config Validation in Bridge

**What it does:** Validates all bridge configuration (socket paths, timeouts, env vars) at startup with clear error messages. Learned from RosClaw — they validate plugin config via Zod schema before the plugin loads.

Currently osModa reads `process.env` raw — a missing socket path silently fails at first use.

```typescript
// Before: silent failure at runtime
const AGENTD_SOCKET = process.env.OSMODA_SOCKET || "/run/osmoda/agentd.sock";

// After: fail fast with clear message at startup
const config = BridgeConfigSchema.parse({
  agentdSocket: process.env.OSMODA_SOCKET ?? "/run/osmoda/agentd.sock",
  keydSocket: process.env.OSMODA_KEYD_SOCKET ?? "/run/osmoda/keyd.sock",
  // ...
});
// If wrong: "BridgeConfig invalid: agentdSocket must be an absolute path"
```

**Files:** `packages/osmoda-bridge/index.ts` (~40 LOC)

---

## Sprint 3 — Product Polish (Following Week)

### 8. Mobile-Friendly Status Dashboard

**What it does:** `GET /status` on agentd returns a self-contained HTML page — server-rendered, no JavaScript required, works in any mobile browser via SSH tunnel or Cloudflare URL.

Shows: hostname, uptime, CPU/RAM/disk gauges, service status grid (green/red), last 5 ledger events.

Auto-refresh every 30s via `<meta http-equiv="refresh">`. Loads in <10KB.

**Use case:** Open your phone, check if the server is healthy in 2 seconds. No chat session needed.

**Files:** `crates/agentd/src/api/status_page.rs` (~200 LOC)

---

### 9. Daily Briefing via Telegram

**What it does:** Every morning at 07:00, the server sends you a summary:

```
📊 osmoda-dev — Mon 24 Feb

Uptime: 12d 4h
CPU: 3% avg (24h)
Disk: 42% used, 58GB free
RAM: 2.1 / 8.0 GB

Events (24h): 127 total, 0 errors
Services: all healthy ✓

Last incident: none
```

Sends via Telegram Bot API. No AI involved — direct from osmoda-routines.

**Config:**
```nix
services.osmoda.channels.telegram.dailyBriefing = {
  enable = true;
  time = "07:00";
  chatId = "123456789";  # your Telegram chat ID
};
```

Or tell the AI: "Send me a daily morning briefing via Telegram at 7am"

**Files:** `crates/osmoda-routines/src/routine.rs` (~100 LOC), `nix/modules/osmoda.nix` (~15 LOC)

---

## Sprint 4 — Mesh-Powered Features (Month 2)

osmoda-mesh is implemented. These features build on top of it.

### 10. Multi-Server Management via Mesh

**What it does:** One osModa instance manages multiple servers. Mesh peers report health, the AI aggregates it.

```
You: "Check all my servers"

osModa:
  web-01 (Berlin)    — healthy, 12% CPU
  db-01 (Frankfurt)  — healthy, 34% CPU
  worker-01 (NYC)    — ⚠ high memory (89%)

  worker-01 needs attention. Want me to investigate?
```

**How it works with mesh:**
- Each server already has osmoda-mesh running (port 18800)
- Peer to peer via `mesh_invite_create` / `mesh_invite_accept` on initial setup
- Hub server calls `mesh_peer_send` with `health_report` message type
- Peers respond with live CPU/RAM/disk/service data
- The AI aggregates responses and presents the combined view

**Relationship to spawn.os.moda:** All provisioned servers already appear in spawn's database. The management dashboard already shows them. The next step: mesh connects them so the AI can query all at once.

**Files:**
- `crates/osmoda-mesh/src/messages.rs` — extend `HealthReport` message with service states
- `packages/osmoda-bridge/index.ts` — `mesh_fleet_status` tool (~50 LOC)
- `templates/AGENTS.md` — multi-server fleet management instructions

---

### 11. Spawn Peer Discovery via Mesh

**What it does:** When you spawn multiple servers, they automatically pair via mesh. No manual invite exchange.

**How:**
1. spawn.os.moda includes each server's mesh public key + endpoint in the cloud-init
2. Each server phone-homes to spawn with its mesh public identity on first boot
3. spawn's `/api/peers?order_id=X` returns peer endpoints for servers in the same account
4. Each server fetches its peer list and initiates mesh connections

**Result:** Buy 3 servers, they connect to each other automatically. AI can query all 3 without manual setup.

**Files:**
- `apps/spawn/server.js` — `/api/peers` endpoint + store mesh identity in heartbeat (~80 LOC)
- `nix/modules/osmoda.nix` — on-boot peer fetch script (~30 LOC)
- `crates/osmoda-mesh/src/` — auto-connect on startup if peers file exists

---

### 12. A2UI Live Dashboard (Canvas)

**What it does:** Inspired by RosClaw's `openclaw-canvas`. The AI sends structured data, the client renders it as interactive widgets — not just text.

**RosClaw uses A2UI (Agent-to-UI, Google Apache 2.0):** Declarative JSONL protocol. AI sends component trees. Client renders them. Same AI, different outputs depending on client type:
- Telegram/WhatsApp → text summary
- Web browser → live gauges, tables, charts
- Mobile app → native components

**For osModa this means:**
```
User: "How's the server doing?"

[Telegram] osModa: Uptime 12d, CPU 3%, RAM 26%, all services healthy.

[Web dashboard] osModa:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ CPU  ████░░░░░░ 38%                 │
  │ RAM  ██░░░░░░░░ 26%  (2.1/8 GB)    │
  │ Disk █████░░░░░ 42%  (42/100 GB)   │
  ├─────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ nginx     ● running  (42d 3h)       │
  │ postgres  ● running  (42d 3h)       │
  │ redis     ● running  (12d 1h)       │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation path:**
1. Bridge tool `canvas_present` sends A2UI JSONL to OpenClaw
2. osmoda-ui interprets A2UI messages alongside regular chat
3. Renders component tree as live HTML widgets
4. Auto-updates when AI sends `dataModelUpdate`

**Files:** `packages/osmoda-bridge/index.ts` (canvas tools, ~100 LOC), `packages/osmoda-ui/index.html` (A2UI renderer, ~300 LOC)

---

### 13. WebRTC P2P via spawn.os.moda

**What it does:** Connect to your home server from a browser — no Cloudflare, no VPN client, no port forwarding. Direct encrypted P2P from browser to server.

**Why this is different from mesh:**
- osmoda-mesh: server-to-server, Noise_XX, always-on P2P between osModa daemons
- WebRTC: browser-to-server, DTLS/SRTP, for the web UI access case

**Architecture:**
```
Your browser
    ↓ 1. Fetch session offer
spawn.os.moda (signaling server — already running)
    ↓ 2. Exchange SDP + ICE candidates
Your osModa server (already phoning home to spawn)
    ↓ 3. WebRTC hole-punch (85-92% direct P2P)
    OR fallback to TURN relay (8-15%)
    ↓ 4. Encrypted data channel
osModa web UI (same as SSH tunnel, but browser-native)
```

**Why spawn.os.moda is the natural signaling server:**
- Every osModa server already has a relationship with spawn.os.moda (heartbeat, order_id)
- Home server registers its WebRTC offer on startup
- Browser fetches the offer, completes the handshake, connects

**Files:**
- `apps/spawn/server.js` (signaling endpoints, ~150 LOC)
- `packages/osmoda-bridge/` (client-side WebRTC, ~200 LOC)
- `nix/modules/osmoda.nix` (register with spawn on startup, ~20 LOC)

## Design Principles for New Features

These come from RosClaw analysis + code-simplifier philosophy:

1. **Talk to set up, not edit config** — Every new feature should be configurable by telling the AI, not editing NixOS files. Config files are the fallback for advanced users.

2. **One conversation, all channels** — New channels join the existing conversation. The AI is one mind across web, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord.

3. **No third party in the data path** — Where possible, keep data off cloud services. Cloudflare Tunnel is a pragmatic exception. osmoda-mesh (Noise_XX + ML-KEM-768) and WebRTC P2P are the principled long-term answers.

4. **Fail fast, fail loudly** — Config errors surface at startup, not at runtime. Zod validation, socket existence checks, required credential checks — all at boot.

5. **Safety bypasses AI** — `/rollback`, `/panic`, `/status` must work even when the AI is broken. Never route emergency commands through the AI pipeline.

6. **Narrow tools over wide tools** — A `service_discover` tool that returns structured data is better than `shell_exec ls /proc`. Structure enables AI reasoning; raw output requires more prompt tokens.

7. **Cryptography is not optional** — osmoda-mesh ships with post-quantum key exchange by default. Security degrades gracefully (if PQ breaks, classical protects), never silently.

8. **MCP over bespoke integrations** — New capabilities come via MCP servers managed by osmoda-mcpd, not new bridge code. osmoda-bridge is the OS layer. Everything else is a managed MCP server.

9. **Payments are OS infrastructure** — x402 micropayments belong in osmoda-egress + osmoda-keyd, not in application code. The AI pays for API calls the same way the OS handles syscalls: transparently, within policy, with an audit trail.
